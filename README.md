# Boilerplate

## Why

Starting lots of new projects, it starts to get tiring repeating project setup.

## What

Boilerplate code for `Phoenix` 1.3.0 app, using `Tachyons` for CSS.
`Elm` setup will be up shortly on a different branch.

## How

When using this boilerplate, you will want to change its name. There are 3 steps -

* Find all lowercase appearances of `boilerplate` and change to `my_app`
* Find all titlecase appearances of `Boilerplate` and change to `My_App`
* Folder names in `/lib` and `/test` need to be changed from `boilerplate` to `my_app`

After this you can follow `Phoenix` instructions below to get up and running.


## Phoenix

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
